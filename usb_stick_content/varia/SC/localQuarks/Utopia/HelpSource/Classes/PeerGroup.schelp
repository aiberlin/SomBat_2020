DESCRIPTION::
PeerGroup is an link::Classes/Array:: subclass that spoofs a link::Classes/NetAddr::. You can use it send messages to a group of link::Classes/Peer::s at the same time. PeerGroups can be constructed manually or using a link::Classes/PeerGroupManager:: which syncs groups across a Utopia. As well, link::Classes/AddrBook:: provides a number of convenience methods:
code::
// assuming ~addrBook contains a properly initialised AddrBook
~addrBook.peers; // a PeerGroup with everybody
~addrBook.others; // a PeerGroup with everybody else in the AddrBook but me
~addrBook.onlinePeers; // a PeerGroup with everybody currently online
~addrBook.excluding('Bob'); // a PeerGroup with everyone but Bob. Poor Bob.
