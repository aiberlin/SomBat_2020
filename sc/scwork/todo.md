- fix Buttons in Modality

- why everything double in the log file?? jack being strange?
-- the IDE's autostart needed to be switched off

- make sure on tinycore to set these paths right:
-- in the yaml file: location of 
--- localQuarks
--- SC's default Class Library
-- install new Python dependency.

# normally on patch, config files are in
# /home/patch/.config/SuperCollider

starting 
start_sombat2020.sh 
from 
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
works fine, it just screws up jack badly!

so... try a systemd service, again??
